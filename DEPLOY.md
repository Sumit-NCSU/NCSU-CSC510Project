# Milestone: DEPLOYMENT

In this milestone, we will be demonstrating a fully deployed version of our CiBot for use in a Slack team.

## Deployment

We are fully provisioning and configuring a remote environment for our bot using the following configuration management tools:

A detailed description of how these configuration tools should be set-up and used is included in the [DeploymentManual.md](DeploymentManual.md) file.
 
### Deployment Scripts

Look into our [deployment script](https://github.ncsu.edu/ssrivas8/CSC510Project/blob/milestone3/deployment/aws.yml)

* Once the script ran successfully, you can check if the forever server started or not.</br>
* You can check the logs of the forever js, using the ID created for that service.</br>
* Currently our server is deployed on **54.209.205.158:4390**, where our bot.js is running.</br>
